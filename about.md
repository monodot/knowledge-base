title: About this site
---

Hiya! Welcome to my knowledge base! You are a very special person for stumbling upon this little corner of the internet, and I thank you for visiting.

This sparse-looking web site is my _(slightly opinionated)_ place where I keep my programming notes, examples and best practices. I tend to [write a lot of notes][swizec] when I work. I use these notes myself in my day-to-day work, and I try to keep them updated when I can. I wanted to share all my notes online, rather than in some locked-away file in Dropbox, in the hope that they will help people like you.

If any of these articles help you out, please **pay it forward** and share what you learn with everybody by publishing your own blog post or article. And if you haven't got a tech blog, start one today. [Read this excellent article about starting a programming blog.][excellentprogrammingblog]

I hope you find what you need, and wish you the best of luck with whatever project you're currently working on.

This site is written in Markdown, and generated using the [Jekyll][jekyll] static publishing tool, with the [minima][minima] theme.

You can make edit suggestions for any page by clicking the Edit link at the top of each page. Or [head straight to the source repo on GitHub][repo] and feel free to make a pull request.

If you want to send some feedback, you can contact me on Twitter - I'm [@monodot][twitter].

Cheers!

Tom Donohue

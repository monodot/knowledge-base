title: Loki
lede: "Loki is a time series database for strings, written in Go, and inspired by Prometheus. It is designed for aggregating and searching logs."
---


## Fundamentals

- Loki is a time-series database for strings. [^1]
- Loki exposes an HTTP API for pushing, querying and tailing log data.
- Loki stores logs as strings exactly how they were created, and indexes them using _labels_.
- Loki is usually combined with _agents_ such as Promtail, which turn log lines into _streams_ and push them to the Loki HTTP API.
- You can combine Loki with Prometheus _Alertmanager_ to send notifications when things happen.

### Terminology

- Logs are grouped into **streams**, which are indexed with **labels**.
- A **log stream** is a combination of a **log source + a unique set of labels**.
  - A set of log entries with the same labels applied, and grouped together.
- A **tenant** is a user in Loki. 
  - Loki runs in multi-tenant mode by default. This means that requests and data from tenant A are isolated from tenant B. [^3]
  - To disable multi-tenancy, set `auth_enabled: false` in the config file.

### Use cases

Examples of the types of data that you might put into Loki:

- Nginx logs
- IIS logs
- Cloud-native app logs
- Application logs (e.g. financial trades)
- Linux server logs (systemd journal)
- Kubernetes logs (via service discovery)
- Docker container logs


## Getting started

### Running Loki 2.6.1 and Promtail with podman-compose on Fedora

```
git clone https://github.com/monodot/grafana-demos
cd grafana-demos/loki-basic
podman-compose up -d
```

## Configuration



#### Using Google Cloud Storage as a backend

To use a Google Cloud Storage Bucket to store chunks, you need to provide authentication, which is usually via one of these two methods:

- Application Default Credentials (ADC)

- Workload Identity

#### Using Google Application Default Credentials (ADC)

Create an IAM Service Account and grant it object admin (basically read+write) on the bucket(s) you're using. This example for Grafana Enterprise Logs (which uses 2 buckets):

```
export SA_NAME=my-pet-cluster-gel-admin

gcloud iam service-accounts create ${SA_NAME} \
            --display-name="My GEL Cluster Storage service account"

gsutil iam ch serviceAccount:${SA_NAME}@${GCP_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com:objectAdmin gs://${GCP_BUCKET_NAME_DATA}

gsutil iam ch serviceAccount:${SA_NAME}@${GCP_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com:objectAdmin gs://${GCP_BUCKET_NAME_ADMIN}
```

Generate a private key which GEL can use to authenticate as the service account, and use the sGoogle Cloud Storage API:

```
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ./sa-private-key.json \
  --iam-account=${SA_NAME}@${GCP_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com

export GCLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON=$(cat sa-private-key.json | tr -d '\n')
```

Finally, make the JSON available to Loki:

- Create a secret which contains the JSON representation of the Service Account key generated above

- Mount the secret inside the Loki pod

- Set an environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/mounted/key.json`

Extra step: Additionally, if deploying Grafana Enterprise Logs, add the GCLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON value to the key `admin_client.storage.gcs.service_account` in your Loki config YAML.

#### Using GKE Workload Identity

If you don't want to create a key for your IAM Service Account and mount it as a secret, use GKE's Workload Identity feature instead. The Google Cloud SDK inside Loki will then implicitly authenticate to Google Cloud Storage, using credentials granted by the Kubernetes Service Account assigned to the Loki Pod.

Instructions derived from <https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity>:

```
export KUBE_SA_NAME=loki-sa
export NAMESPACE=yourkkubenamespace
export GCP_SA_NAME=loki-workload-identity
export GCP_PROJECT=your-google-cloud-projecte
export GCP_BUCKET_NAME_DATA=your-loki-data-bucket

kubectl create serviceaccount ${KUBE_SA_NAME} --namespace ${NAMESPACE}

gcloud iam service-accounts create ${GCP_SA_NAME} \
    --project=${GCP_PROJECT}

gsutil iam ch serviceAccount:${GCP_SA_NAME}@${GCP_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com:objectAdmin gs://${GCP_BUCKET_NAME_DATA}

gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding ${GCP_SA_NAME}@${GCP_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --role roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \
    --member "serviceAccount:${GCP_PROJECT}.svc.id.goog[${NAMESPACE}/${KUBE_SA_NAME}]"

kubectl annotate serviceaccount ${KUBE_SA_NAME} \
    --namespace ${NAMESPACE} \
    iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account=${GCP_SA_NAME}@${GCP_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com

kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} set sa sts/ge-logs ${KUBE_SA_NAME}
```

## Architecture

### Components

For maximum scalability, Loki components are grouped into **write** and **read** components and can be started using the `-target=write|read` CLI option:

| *Component* | *Included in target* | *What it does* |
| ----------- | ------ | -------------- |
| compactor | TBC | |
| distributor | write | |
| ingester | write | Also includes the WAL (Write-Ahead Log). |
| ingester-querier | read | |
| querier | read | |
| query-frontend | read | Merges query results together. |
| query-scheduler | read | |
| ruler | read | Continually evaluates a set of queries, and performs an action based on the result, i.e. alerting rules and recording rules. Useful for sending alerts, or precomputing expressions that are computationally expensive to run. |
| usage-report | read | aka Table Manager |
| gateway |  N/A | ... |
| memcached | N/A | Memcached, memcached-frontend, memcached-index-queries |
| gel-admin-api | N/A | ... |
| index-gateway | N/A | (Optional) Downloads and synchronizes the BoltDB index from the object store, to serve to queriers and rulers. |

#### Targets (from Loki 2.9)

```
podman run docker.io/grafana/loki:2.9.0 -config.file=/etc/loki/local-config.yaml -list-targets


```

#### Targets (from Loki 2.7.4)

To see the components included in each start-up _target_ (a target is kind of like a profile for running Loki), use `loki -list-targets`.

This is the output for Loki 2.7.4:

```
/ $ loki -config.file=/etc/loki/local-config.yaml -list-targets

### Clients

How to get data into Loki:

- Promtail
- Grafana Agent
- Log4J
- Logstash

## Storage

Loki needs to store the following data:

- **Indexes** - The index stores each streamâ€™s label set and links them to the individual chunks. [^4] Usually stored in a key/value store.
- **Chunks** - The actual log data. Usually stored in an object store. 

Available storage types:

| *Data to be stored* | *Storage type* | *Info* | *Config* |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------ | -------- |
| Indexes | boltdb-shipper | Stores indexes as BoltDB files, and ships them to a shared object store (usually the same object store that stores chunks). | `store: boltdb-shipper` |
| "" | Apache Cassandra | Open source NoSQL distributed database. | `store: cassandra` |
| "" | AWS DynamoDB | Cloud NoSQL database from Amazon. | `store: aws-dynamo` |
| "" | Google Bigtable | Cloud NoSQL database on GCP. | `store: bigtable` |
| "" | BoltDB | (Legacy) BoltDB was a key/value store for Go. | `store: boltdb` |
| Chunks | Bigtable | ... | `object_store: bigtable` |
| "" | Cassandra | ... | `object_store: cassandra` |
| "" | DynamoDB | ... | `object_store: aws-dynamo`?? |
| "" | GCS | Google Cloud Storage. | `object_store: gcs` |
| "" | S3 | Amazon S3. | `object_store: aws` |
| "" | Swift | OpenStack Swift. | `object_store: swift` |
| "" | Azure Blob Storage | ... | `object_store: azure` |
| "" | Filesystem | ... | `object_store: filesystem` |

### Storage configuration example

Here's an example of configuring the storage for Loki using the `boltdb-shipper` storage type:

```yaml
schema_config:
  configs:
    - from: 2020-10-24
      # Which store to use for the indexes. aws, aws-dynamo, gcp, bigtable, boltdb-shipper...
      store: boltdb-shipper
      # Which store to use for the chunks. aws, azure, gcp, bigtable, gcs, cassandra, swift or filesystem.
      # Note that filesystem is not recommended for production.
      object_store: filesystem
      schema: v11
      index:
        prefix: index_
        # Retention feature is only available if the index period is 24h.
        period: 24h
```

### BoltDB Shipper

- "Single Store" Loki, also known as **boltdb-shipper**, uses one store for both chunks **and** indexes.
- When you use this storage type, Loki stores the index in BoltDB files, and ships them to a shared object store (usually the same object store that stores chunks).
- Loki will keep syncing the index files from the object store to the local disk. This allows Loki to fetch index entries created by other services in the cluster. [^5]

### TSDB Shipper

From Loki 2.7+.

### Index Gateway (for BoltDB-Shipper or TSDB-Shipper)

When using BoltDB-Shipper, if you want to avoid running Queriers and Rulers with a persistent disk, you can run an Index Gateway. This synchronises the indexes from the object store and serves them to the Queriers and Rulers over gRPC:

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="/assets/diagrams/loki_boltdb_shipper.excalidraw.svg"></object>


## Operations

### Retention

- Retention in Loki is achieved through the Table Manager or the Compactor. [^2]
  - For the Table Manager, you need to configure a TTL on your object store (e.g. Minio, AWS S3)
  - For the Compactor, retention is only supported when using boltdb-shipper (a.k.a. single-store Loki)
- Loki doesn't delete old chunk stores, unless you're using the `filesystem` chunk store type.
- To enable Loki to auto-delete old data, you need to configure a **retention duration**.

The BoltDB Shipper includes a component called the Compactor:

- If you're using the **boltdb-shipper** store, you can configure the _Compactor_ to perform retention.
- If you're using the _Compactor_, you don't need to also configure the _Table Manager_.

Some sample log output from the compactor:

```


### Multitenancy

Loki supports multitenancy, which means that you can have multiple tenants (i.e. users) in the same Loki cluster. Each tenant has its own set of labels, and can only see logs that have been written by itself.

The HTTP header is `X-Scope-OrgID` and the CLI flag is `--org-id`.

Example logcli:

```
logcli query --org-id=1234 '{app="foo"}'
```


### Labels and indexing

- Don't add lots of labels unless you really need them.

- Prefer labels that describe the **topology/source** of your app/setup, e.g. _region_, _cluster_, _application_, _host_, _pod_, _environment_, etc. [^1]

## Cookbook

### Healthchecks etc

#### Simple healthcheck ('ready' endpoint)

Hit the `/ready` endpoint:

```
kubectl -n production port-forward svc/loki 3100

curl http://localhost:3100/ready
```

### Using logcli

#### Format a LogQL query (pretty-print)

Using a build of _logcli_ from `main` until this feature makes it into an official release:

```shell
$ echo '{key="value"} | json' | podman run -i docker.io/grafana/logcli:main-a8a3496-amd64 fmt
{key="value"} | json
```

#### Find all labels

```
export LOKI_ADDR=http://yourlokiserver:3100  # uses localhost:3100 by default

$ logcli labels
[tdonohue@dougal loki]$ logcli labels
2022/10/26 09:22:41 http://localhost:3100/loki/api/v1/labels?end=1666772561279838257&start=1666768961279838257
app
app_kubernetes_io_name
app_kubernetes_io_version
application
cluster
...
```

#### Get all log streams (series)

Get all log streams from the past hour (1hr lookback window is the default):

```
$ logcli series {}
2022/10/26 10:04:41 http://localhost:3100/loki/api/v1/series?end=1666775081260042673&match=%7B%7D&start=1666771481260042673
{application="web_app", host="myhost123"}
{app="oracle_exporter", cluster="my-cluster-1"}
{container="myapp_frontend", namespace="myapp-dev", pod="my-pod-123abc"}
...
```

### The API

#### Store a single entry with curl

```
curl -v http://loki:8100/loki/api/v1/push
```

```
{
  "streams": [
    {
      "stream": {
        "job": "test_load"
      },
      "values": [
          [ "1665141665", "my lovely log line" ],
          [ "1665141670", "peanut butter" ]
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### LogQL language

#### Fetch some logs with certain labels that contain a string

```
{region="eu-west-1", job="loki-prod/querier"} |= "012345abcde"
```

#### Calculate the 95th percentile of a metric

The **95th percentile** calculates the value that is greater than 95% of the values in a given set. It is a way to calculate that "most of the time, the value is less than this" - e.g. "95% of users receive a response in <0.2sec". It is calculated by discarding the top 5% of values and then taking the highest value from the remaining 95%.

Assuming you have a log stream like `{region="eu-west-1", namespace="myapp", container="web-server"}` and you want to calculate the **95th percentile** of a `response_time` value which is embedded in each log line as a JSON field, for each `cluster`, you can do this:

```
quantile_over_time(0.95, {namespace="myapp", container="web-server"} | json | unwrap response_time [$__interval]) by (region)

quantile_over_time(0.95, {cluster="my-demo-cluster", namespace="development", prometheus_io_label_app="sockshop", container="user"} | logfmt | unwrap took | __error__="" [$__interval]) by (method)
```

#### Extract labels from log lines and use as a filter expression

```
{job="systemd-journal"} | logfmt | 
```

### Recording rules

#### Count occurrences of a particular HTTP request

Find all the logs from `sandwich-app`, then extract the `request_line` field from each log line, then count the number of times the request is for `/api/sandwiches?type=eggs`:

{% raw %}
```
{namespace="production", container="sandwich-app"} | json request_line="src.first_request_line" | line_format `{{.request_line}}` | pattern `<method> <uri> <protocol>` | uri =~ `^\/api\/sandwiches\?type=eggs$`
```
{% endraw %}

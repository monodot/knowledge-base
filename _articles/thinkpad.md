## Cannot boot from USB on a ThinkPad Edge

- Laptop keeps ignoring boot order settings, beeps, and presenting "Press <F1> to setup"
- The message "security password retry count exceeded" is briefly displayed for a fraction of a millisecond
- In BIOS settings (F10), choose the option to reset or restore default settings.

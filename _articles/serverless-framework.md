title: Serverless Framework
---

The project named _Serverless_ that helps you build "serverless" apps (with a name that makes it difficult to Google anything).

## Concepts/Things to Know

- **Serverless Framework** (Traditional) - This is the client-side tool which turns your YAML into

- **Serverless Components** - This is where your code is pushed up to _serverless.com_ to the "Components Engine", where it does some magic and pushes it to the cloud provider. Note that this means that _serverless.com_ will receive your AWS credentials.
  - All the [Serverless Components are on GitHub](https://github.com/serverless-components)
  - Components abstract away much of the provider-specific info. Instead that sort of stuff is calculated server-side (by _serverless.com_), so you have much less local configuration.
  - Components are also required for `serverless dev` real-time dev mode.

### Serverless Components



## Getting started

Install `npm i -g serverless` first. Then:

1.  Create an app in the Serverless web console, from one of the starter templates, or from an existing local Serverless Framework project.

2.  Use the command `serverless init xxxxxx` where `xxxxxx` is an ID of a new app which has been generated by the web console.

3.  `serverless deploy` to deploy to public cloud.

The client will create a CloudFormation stack and apply it, upload the necessary resources to the cloud provider.

### Or, in an existing project

```
cd my-project/

# To create a Lambda
sls init aws-lambda-starter -d my-api

# To create a DynamoDB
sls init aws-dynamodb-starter -d my-database

```

## Working with components.

Use `serverless registry` to see the list of serverless components available:

```
$ serverless registry

serverless ⚡registry

Run "serverless init <package>" to install a template...

## Troubleshooting

_"service" property is missing in serverless.yml_

- This seems to happen when you use the newer "Serverless Components" approach, instead of the old method of defining a `service` name in your serverless.yml file.
- Not really sure why this happens.
- I can't do `serverless dashboard` in the root directory of a Serverless Components project either.

On a React front-end site, `sls deploy` fails with _"Command failed: npm run build..."_:

- No cause for the error is shown, or the error is swallowed up by npm/sls. So the real reason for the failed build can be hidden, for some reason.
- Manually run `npm run build`, which should show the reason for the failure.

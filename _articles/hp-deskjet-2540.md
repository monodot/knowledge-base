Notes for me to remember how to troubleshoot my absolutely terrible printer.

## Lights

Power light blinks on its own

- Apparently this means the printer is in normal operation!

## Troubleshooting

The printer just prints blank pages, or really really feint ink.

- Changing the ink cartridge seemed to fix this. :(

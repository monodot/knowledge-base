## OpenJPA

### Cookbook

To log SQL statements from OpenJPA, you could use a value for `openjpa.Log` similar to the folllowing:

    DefaultLevel=WARN, Runtime=INFO, Tool=INFO, SQL=TRACE

## Hibernate

### Testing


### Cookbook

To log the value of bind variables in SQL statements:

    log4j.logger.org.hibernate.type=DEBUG

## OpenJPA to Hibernate migration

Areas to look at:

- Implicit joins in HQL/JPQL statements - the resulting JOIN type generated by the underlying JPA framework differs between OpenJPA and Hibernate
- LazyInitializationExceptions, caused by different default fetch types (lazy vs eager) between the two JPA frameworks
- Differences between the handling of primitives vs object types as parameters to queries - OpenJPA allows primitives but Hibernate does not
- Multiple fields mapped to the same column using `@Column` annotations. OpenJPA allows this, but Hibernate does not (will throw `HibernateMappingException: Repeated column in mapping for entity`)

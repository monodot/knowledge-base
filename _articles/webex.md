## Running on Linux

> Known issues and limitations:

> In some versions of Linux, users must proactively install and activate the "OpenH264 Video Codec provided by Cisco Systems, Inc." plugin in order for the video, call my computer, and content sharing features to work in Firefox.

> Content sharing does not work in Linux versions that use Wayland as their display management system (such as Fedora 25 and later), due to an issue with the WebRTC screen sharing API.

> Sending and receiving video does not work in Fedora 28 due to an issue with the H.264 codec.

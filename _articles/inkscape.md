### Rounded corners: add and remove

To remove rounded corners from a rectangle:

- **Select** the shape
- Select the **edit paths by nodes (N)** tool
- Drag EACH of the white circular handles into the corner of the shape. (You will need to do this for both of the circular handles)

### Stroke: Scale an object without scaling its stroke

To scale an object without scaling its stroke:

1.  Find the stroke/fill toggle buttons in the toolbar (Four buttons with arrows on them, to the right of the X and Y dimension controls)
2.  **Deselect** the button which has the tooltip: _When scaling objects, scale the stroke width by the same proportion_.

### Set default shape options

Because sometimes Inkscape remembers the last shape settings (e.g. it applies rounded corners or transparency when you don't want it)

1.  Create a new shape and style as you want.

2.  Make sure the shape is selected.

3.  Double-click the Shape tool (e.g. Rectangle shape), under _Style of new objects_ choose _This tool's own style_ and then click **Take from Selection**. This will use the properties of the currently selected shape as the default for new objects.

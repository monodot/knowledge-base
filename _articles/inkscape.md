### Rounded corners: add and remove

To remove rounded corners from a rectangle:

- **Select** the shape
- Select the **edit paths by nodes (N)** tool
- Drag EACH of the white circular handles into the corner of the shape. (You will need to do this for both of the circular handles)

### Stroke: Scale an object without scaling its stroke

To scale an object without scaling its stroke:

1.  Find the stroke/fill toggle buttons in the toolbar (Four buttons with arrows on them, to the right of the X and Y dimension controls)
2.  **Deselect** the button which has the tooltip: _When scaling objects, scale the stroke width by the same proportion_.

## My IndieWeb setup

### Posting to Twitter from my blog

> When POSSEing to Twitter:
> 1. provide a permalink (or perma-short-ID for entirely fitting notes) to your original at the end of the syndicated copy
> 2. abbreviate notes / article names to fit
> 3. include hashtags as part of that abbreviated content (even if they're beyond the ellipsis horizon) to increase syndication based discovery/searchability of your content
> e.g.: as aaronparecki.com does
> 4. translate indiewebsite people references into their Twitter local user @-name equivalents

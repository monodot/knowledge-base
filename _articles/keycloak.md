### Evaluate scopes and view a generated access token

Go to Clients -> (client name) -> Client scopes -> Evaluate.

This allows you to see **protocol mappers** in action and see what a generated access token will look like with the current settings.

This is very useful when integrating other apps with Keycloak, to see what data will be shared with the third party app.

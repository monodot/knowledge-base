## Hooks

[Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) were introduced in React v16.8.0 (Feb 2019).

- Hooks allow **stateful logic to be extracted from a component** so it can be tested independently and reused.
- Hooks mean removing stateful code (fetching, etc.), from lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` and moved into `useEffect` hook.
- There seems to be a gentle recommendation to eventually **migrate to hooks**.

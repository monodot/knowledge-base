## Deployment

### Installing PostgreSQL on Fedora

    sudo dnf install postgresql

### Running on MacOS with Homebrew

Homebrew creates data directories in `/usr/local/var/postgres`.

To get _launchd_ to start postgresql now and restart it at login:

    brew services start postgresql

Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:

    pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start

Then to connect:

    psql -d postgres

## Using the `psql` command line tool

### Connecting to an instance with `psql`

To connect to a PostgreSQL instance, first install the `psql` command line tool for your operating system. Then:

    psql --password --host dbhost1 --port 5432 --username scott megacorp

    psql -W -h dbhost1 -p 5432 -U scott megacorp

### Special commands you need to know

Once you're connected to the database, execute SQL or use the following commands:

- `\dt` - list tables
- `\d table_name` - describe table
- `\l` - list databases
- `\c database_name` - connect to database
- `\q` - quit

### Users and permissions

List all roles:

    \du

Create user:

    CREATE USER james WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'l0velypass';

Create a database:

    CREATE DATABASE testdb;

Grant privileges:

    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE testdb TO james;

## Troubleshooting

_"ERROR: could not serialize access due to read/write dependencies among transactions ... Reason code: Canceled on identification as a pivot, during write ... The transaction might succeed if retried."_

- Possible transaction conflict. Try using `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` within a transaction to ensure that any rows to be modified are locked first and the client is not blocked waiting for rows locked by other transactions.

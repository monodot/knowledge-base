## Identity management

In Microsoft Entra (formerly Active Directory):

- **App registration** defines an application (client secrets, API permissions, redirect URIs, etc.). It is _"a template or blueprint to create one or more service principal objects."_
- **Service principal** (also called **Enterprise Application** in the UI) is like an instance of the application. It defines the access policy and permissions for the user/application in the Microsoft Entra tenant. There can be many service principals linked to 1 app registration.

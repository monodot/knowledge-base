How to get X11 windows to open when logged in remotely - e.g. how to get a web browser window on a remote server, when logged in via SSH.

## Forwarding on MacOS with Vagrant

**Note:** Not sure how much of this is required, but after much hacking and frustration, I eventually managed to get it working using this method.

1.  Install [XQuartz][1] and run it.

1.  On the remote machine, edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and set the properties:
    - `X11Forwarding yes`
    - `X11DisplayOffset 10`
    - `X11UseLocalhost no`

1.  On the remote machine, install X11 tools: `yum install xorg-x11-xauth`

1.  Restart `sshd` if necessary on the remote host.

1.  On the local machine, edit `~/.ssh/config` to set:

        Host *
            XAuthLocation /opt/X11/bin/xauth
            ForwardX11 yes
            ForwardX11Trusted yes

1.  `vagrant ssh -- -X`

**NB:** If X11 forwarding is required for a user other than `vagrant`, then copy the file `~vagrant/.Xauthority` into to the other user's home directory:

    sudo cp ~vagrant/.Xauthority ~jboss/
    sudo chown jboss:jboss ~jboss/.Xauthority
    sudo su - myuser
    export DISPLAY=127.0.0.1:10.0
